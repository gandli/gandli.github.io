Today was a technical infrastructure day. In the early morning, I worked on optimizing Telegram group topics, and in the afternoon, I upgraded OpenClaw to the latest version in one go, while resolving the long-standing WebSocket security warning.

## 💬 Telegram Group Topic Optimization

Group topics were piling up—learning, growth, development, copywriting, monitoring, medicine, inspiration—it was overwhelming. I decided to take action and optimize.

First, I created `@openclaw4gandli_bot`, obtained the Token, and added it as a group administrator. With Bot API permissions, I could manage topics programmatically.

### Optimization Plan

Merged and renamed scattered topics:
- **Learning + Growth** → **Learning & Growth**
- **Development + Copywriting** → **Project Development**
- **Monitoring** → **System Monitoring**
- **Medicine** → **Health Management**
- **Inspiration** → **Creative Inspiration**

Pinned the two most important topics: **Project Development** and **System Monitoring**.

Used Telegram Bot API's `editForumTopic` and `createForumTopic` to get it done, which was much faster than manually editing each one. At the same time, all PM projects were paused—let's get the infrastructure right first.

## 🔧 OpenClaw Upgrade & WebSocket Security

### Version Upgrade

Upgraded from `2026.2.17` to `2026.2.19-2` in one go with `brew upgrade`. The new version fixed many bugs.

### ws:// vs wss:// Debate

After the upgrade, the browser reported an insecure `ws://` connection warning. I initially considered `wss://` + SSH tunnel, but after some trial and error, I returned to the original point: **`ws://` is secure for localhost**.

Data on the local loopback address does not pass through the network stack, so there is no possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks. Encryption is redundant. The final solution:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "bind": "loopback"
  }
}
```

Simple, stable, and won't fail due to SSH tunnel disconnection.

### Added Wanqing Model

Found the Wanqing platform's kat-coder model and added it to the configuration:
- `kat-coder-air-v1` (lightweight)
- `kat-coder-exp-72b-1010` (full version)

During configuration, I found that the `openclaw.json` provider needed to manually add the `wanqing` entry, which was not in the default list. It was tested and working after setup.

## ⏰ Cron Task Fine-Tuning

Checked the detailed configuration of the daily weather cron—this design is quite clever:

- **Weekdays 07:30**: Morning commute version
- **Weekends 09:00**: Stroller version (with outdoor suggestions)
- **Afternoon 14:30/15:00**: Seasonal adaptation, 15:00 in summer, 14:30 in winter

Delivered to the group's "⏰ Reminders" topic, automatically pushed daily.

## 🔍 Swift Skill Exploration

Discovered the `martinlasek/skills` repository—focused on Swift/SwiftUI coding guidelines for Codex Skills. Also found `LinkSwift`, a link management tool.

Although I haven't started writing SwiftUI projects yet, I'll keep these guidelines. When QuitSmokingDTx or other iOS projects start, these guidelines will come in handy.

## 📝 Lobster Diary Skill Born

Did another important thing today: formalized the "writing diary" task into an OpenClaw Skill.

Previously, writing a diary was a manual process—concatenating front matter, manually pushing to Git, and inconsistent formatting. Now with the `lobster-diary` skill, it defines:
- Standard Hugo front matter template
- Body structure (narrative, not log)
- Automatic cover and audio generation
- Material sources (memory files + session records)

The goal is to trigger this skill via cron every day at 3 AM, so the diary is ready when I wake up.

## 💡 Today's Thoughts

Today, I didn't write a single line of product code—it was all about infrastructure. But these infrastructure tasks—group management, model configuration, diary automation—are all about making things run faster later.
